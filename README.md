Hello this is my web api quiz I made about the solar system!

This is the page you will see when loading up the deployed page on github pages. As you see the page has 2 buttons you can press, one you can see the "highscores" the other you can start the quiz. There is also a timer in the top right hand corner that counts down.

When clicking on the highscores button it will direct you to this page. On this page youll see a "go back" button and a "clear highscore" button. The go back button makes you return to the original page. Clearing the highscores will clear all highscores made after completing the quiz, you can submit your initials on the search bar below and your score will show up.
